# Introduction

A CCSV (Control-Character-Separated Values file) is a file format that enables moving data between spreadsheets, statistical analysis programs, databases, and any other program that works with rectangular data. It is very similar to (CSV) Comma-Separated Values files {{!RFC4180}}, (TSV) Tab-Separated Values files, and their derivatives. Unlike those file types, the CCSV minimizes usage ambiguity by having non-printable characters as delimiters. The two delimiter characters may not appear in the document's text, making the practice of escaping certain characters or adding additional delimiters for certain strings unnecessary. This document seeks to define the format of Control Character Separated Values (CCSV) files and formally register the "text/ccsv" Media Type for CCSV in accordance with {{!RFC6838}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

## Definition of the CCSV format

In order for a file to be a CCSV, it MUST adhere to the following formatting rules:

### Formatting Rules

1. The file MUST use UTF-8 encoding. Since US-ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, programs may create CCSV files with that encoding.  A consuming program may not be able to interpret all characters if it only works with US-ASCII and SHOULD work with UTF-8 if the source is unknown.
1. The file MUST NOT begin with a Byte Order Mark (U+FEFF).
1. A CCSV MUST begin with a header.  The header consists of the names of the columns separated with US (U+001F) entities.
1. A Unit Separator US (U+001F) is used between each field in a record. Note that carriage returns and line feeds are not part of the delimiter and are valid characters in the body of a field.
1. A Record Separator RS (U+001E) is used between each record in the file including the header.
1. A Record Separator RS (U+001E) MAY appear as the last entity of the last record but is NOT RECOMMENDED.
1. The header and each record, if any, MUST contain the same number of US (U+001F) entities.  Consequently, the header and every record will have the same number of fields.
1. Empty fields are represented by consecutive delimiters.
1. The US (U+001F) entity and the RS (U+001E) entity MUST NOT appear in the body of a field.

The ABNF grammar {{!STD68}} appears as follows:

~~~~
file = header RS *(record RS) [record]
header = name *( US name )
record = field *( US field )
name = field
field = *VCHAR
VCHAR = %x00-1D / %x20-D7FF / %xE000-10FFFF ; all characters except the designated delimiters and surrogates
RS = %x1E ; record separator
US = %x1F ; unit separator
~~~~

# Encoding Considerations
CCSV files MUST be encoded using UTF-8 {{!RFC3629}}.

Implementations MUST NOT add a byte order mark (U+FEFF) to the beginning of the file or networked-transmitted text.

## Why UTF-8?

### Compatibility

UTF-8 is widely supported across different platforms, operating systems, and languages.  This ensures that CCSV files can be opened and read correctly regardless of the environment they are used in.

### Internationalization

UTF-8 supports a vast range of characters from various languages, including those that use non-Latin scripts. This is crucial for data that might include international names, addresses, or other text in multiple languages, ensuring that all characters are preserved and displayed correctly.

### Efficiency

UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding scheme that uses 1 to 4 bytes for each character. It is efficient for encoding text that is primarily in English, as it uses only one byte for the most common characters, but can still accommodate characters from other languages when needed.

### Standardization

By requiring UTF-8, the CCSV format ensures a standard way of encoding text, which simplifies processing, parsing, and exchanging files. It helps in avoiding the complexities and potential errors that can arise from dealing with multiple encodings.

### Future-Proofing

As the internet and technologies continue to evolve, UTF-8 remains a robust and forward-compatible choice, ensuring that CCSV files remain accessible and usable in the long term

# Security Considerations

CCSV files alone are considered relatively harmless as there is no additional prescribed processing. However, the file may be parsed and further processed by the recipient. To the extent that a receiving application executes arbitrary system level commands from strings contained in a CCSV file, they may be at risk.

# Interoperability Considerations

Adherence to the Formatting Rules {{formatting-rules}} and the Encoding Considerations {{encoding-considerations}} ensures a high level of interoperability.
